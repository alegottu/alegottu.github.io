I'd say the game is fully "prototypable" now; I've moved on from menus and mechanics and started work on the first level, and I recommended my partner to begin working on character art when he has the time. We decided early on that we wanted the player character to be a compass, because it would enhance the game's motif towards navigation and would make for a neat physics-based animation as the player rolls around, jittering the hands of the compass and bumping the top bevel occasionally. As for the first level: it will mostly function as a tutorial level for the puzzles, whereas the menu actually introduces the platforming (instead of a standard menu, the player navigates the buttons as platforms). I started work on a system for the player to move a tile by a space equal to its length or height using buttons, since the basic idea is for the player to not know what those buttons do until they use the workstation. I hit a roadblock almost immediately, realizing that the path would have to be reversed once the player presses the button a certain amount of times so that the tile stays within certain boundaries. I've put aside all that confusing math for now and just made sure all the logic worked flawlessly.
