            <p>At this point in time I've been able to complete the second level in the game. Learning how to implement interactions within the level itself, such as checkpoints or unique changes in the environment has been an interesting process to digest, deciding whether to implement those behaviors as an entirely separate object, or to have them connected with a unique script for the level itself. We still need to playtest outside of just self-testing, but there is some other progress that I think is worth noting at this point in time. Before completing the second level, I was also able to fine tune the movement a bit more, giving more control to the player while strafing in the air, and also making it so that the player consistently bounces when they land on the blunt end of the pin. Due to the decomposition of the logic and methods these two mechanics require that I handled earlier in the project, both were surprisingly easy to get working right away. I'm sure there's still bugs and room for improvement, but it was rather easy to branch from the existing tools and data I laid out for myself to implement new features. I feel as though I'm starting to get a feel for the balance between planning ahead to make life for your future self easier, but also not getting too far ahead of yourself and overcompensating with maintenance or features that you don't need. With all the progress up to now, the game is feeling very lively in terms of mechanics and movement, but it still definitely needs some love visually. Using Unity's new 2D lighting system, I'm starting to devise a lighting system for the game where we not only continue to make the game based around hidden information, but also make it look good while doing it. I'm not too far into this process yet, but luckily there hasn't been too steep of a learning curve yet, especially considering that I've never worked with lighting in any context practically. </p>
