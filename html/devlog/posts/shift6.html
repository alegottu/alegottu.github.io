            <p>Finally back to work. After taking a step back, the inevitable reworks have come. We decided to scrap the idea of a compass in favor of going for a photorealistic corkboard artistic theme, so in order to fit the schema, the player could pretty much only be a thumbtack. I still managed to fit in all the fun procedural animation I wanted, though, and I acquired that result much easier by using a tool called DOTween. Looking through the classes and documentation, the package definitely considers a lot more variables than I did when I tried to animate objects with scripts simply by adding onto their euler angles. Instead, this package uses scriptable objects to take into account parameters like the duration of a singular animation more easily, which can be repeated with any interpolation algorithm as well in order to make objects animate with player input in scripts just as easily. So far, I have only made the player rotate around while they move, but I want to make it so that the animation conveys weight as it reaches the blunt end of the thumbtack. I also attempted to make the collision boxes rotate around with the player, and it seems to work okay, except for when the player is horizontally flat. This might fix itself by making a more accurate approximated mesh for the character, however, as it is still just a longer rectangle for now. </p>
