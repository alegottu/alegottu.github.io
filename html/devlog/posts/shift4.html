            <p>Work on the first level is proving to be more fundamentally difficult then I thought. Because the player has to be able to control the moving tile but also doesn't know where the tile is going, its the game's job to make sure it keeps within a certain boundary, and that it changes direction when needed. My first attempt at programming this was a complete mess, using far too many variables all within the fixed update loop, and using an odd mix of booleans to lerp the value once the player's input is recognized. I was hesitant to just abort the entire thing, because it almost worked, save for occasionally going in the opposite direction at ludicrous speeds (oops). However, I came to my senses and decided to decompose it into a separate method and go back to basics. The player won't be able to see the actual smooth movement of the tile anyways, as they will just be procedurally checking on its position. Of course, managing just to change the tiles position based on a trigger enter event in the player script was fairly simple, and I'm now in the process of making a boolean method to signify if a Vector2 needs to clamped based on another Vector2. It was successful in only the left direction, so I might have to change the comparison to only one direction by making the second parameter multiply a specific axis of the other Vector2. It was my first time learning how to use the distance of vectors to compare them, so I felt pretty content where I left off.</p>
