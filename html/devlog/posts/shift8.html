            <p>Now that I've finally begun to settle in with the pressure to study from exams, I've found some time for myself to continue development again. In fact, I practically felt an urge to fix something for our game; I know it's bad habit to compare, but I see other developers online making so much progress in such little time, and I definitely feel a strange mix of inspiration and a need to catch up seeing that while I also have to focus on school. When I actually got to development though, instead of refactoring for a smoother development going forward, I went on a whole other tangent entirely, seeking to make the player's movement more fun. If I do say so myself, even though I came upon the idea accidentally, I think it fits the game particularly well, and adds to the identity that I've been looking for. I ended up changing how the player rotates while moving in midair using logic based on the current collision system: while the player is in midair, they rotate faster, but through a bit of extra physics, they can also stop spinning while still moving in the same direction, or gradually progress to spinning in the opposite direction, and also moving in the opposite direction. It's not perfect yet, but it borders on the style between realism and fantasy that the game needs.</p>
