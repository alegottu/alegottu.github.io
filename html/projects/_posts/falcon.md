This project is a small physics demo born from everyone's dream to flap their wings and take flight. It also serves as a design experiment to make something fun with mobile controls and interface in mind (despite being played with a mouse for now), as well as a test for me as a developer to start small, and find a balance of accounting for future expansions, as well as only expanding when needed.
