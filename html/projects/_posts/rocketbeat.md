This project is currently a work in progress, but you can take a closer look [here](https://github.com/alegottu/RocketBeat)!

Rocket Beat is my idea for a rocket-jumping, explosive based fighting game turned into a deep dive into low-level gameplay programming and data-oriented design. As I've matured more as a developer, I've realized it's important to pay close attention to the performance as your code, as the quicker it runs, the better and more equal of an experience everyone can have with your game. Especially for fighting games, fair play and healthy competition are paramount and breed thriving communities, so even if I have to take the long way around, I want to find a way to do this one right. For now, the project is only a skeleton of SDL2 code, made to support rocket physics, frame data, and much more later.
