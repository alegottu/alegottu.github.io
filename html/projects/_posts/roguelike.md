This project was my first collaborative effort, aside from fun projects I helped my friends with, and I worked as the lead programmer in a team of six. It was a learning experience to have to plan ahead in order to make sure the important parts of the code could be a foundation for my fellow developers to pick up on, as well as to make sure to be extra clear in the way that I write my code, and be diligent in communicating anything that wasn't quite there. I also got the opportunity to experience a good use case for abstract classes, as well as to really hunker down and focus on making player movement and control simple yet satisfying, as well as visually responsive.
