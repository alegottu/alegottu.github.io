<p>During the summer of 2020, I became infatuated with chess due to its resurgence in the online gaming community during the pandemic. I thought to make an experience that was centered around making the game more fast paced and less reliant on memorization, while still allowing for the thought-provoking creation of tactics. Along the way, I realized just how complex the game of chess is by having to program all the logic for each of the pieces from scratch, as well as having to account for some of the more nuanced rules in an optimized way. </p>
